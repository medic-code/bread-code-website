This is a list of all the tools that I use for sourdough baking. All of them have been tested by me.

# Tools

[Amazy Banneton Batard](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01IDELMWO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title). I like those bannetons as they come with a linen included already.

[CanDeal Loaf Pan for 1000gr](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07Y4ZBPDQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This loaf pan has a lid which makes it easy to create steam. You can remove the lid later on. No need to add additional steam to your oven. This makes it very easy.

[Infrared Thermometer](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07NY5RH9X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title). A great thermometer to check temperatures. Easy to use and also has a good display that works when it is dark.

[AmzBBQ Gloves](https://www.amazon.de/AMZBBQ-Premium-Grillhandschuhe-Ofenhandschuhe-Hitzebest%C3%A4ndig/dp/B07CN7FBBH/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=amzbbq&qid=1598886330&sr=8-5). Great gloves that handle high temperature very well. I have recently switched to "Brovn" gloves that come with the Brovn dutch oven. However the AMZBBQ gloves work excellent as well and are a more low budget option that I have used for years.

I will be slowly adding more tools here.
