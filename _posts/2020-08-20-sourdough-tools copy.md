This is a list of all the tools that I use for sourdough baking. All of them have been tested by me.

# Tools

[Amazy Banneton Batard](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01IDELMWO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title). I like those bannetons as they come with a linen included already. I have the ones that are roughly 28cm in length for my batards. They work well for up to 500 grams of flour.

[CanDeal Loaf Pan for 1000gr](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07Y4ZBPDQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This loaf pan has a lid which makes it easy to create steam. You can remove the lid later on. No need to add additional steam to your oven. This makes it very easy.

[Kaiser Loaf Pan](https://amzn.to/3m7sJkI). It's a great loaf pan and has the dimensions: 30cm x 12cm x 9cm. It seems they made the newer ones slightly larger, but that will be even better. I use it for around 400-500 grams of flour based dough. You shouldn't be going much higher. So 500 grams of flour and 350 grams of water will work well. Not a lot more or else the dough will rise too much.

[Infrared Thermometer](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07NY5RH9X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title). A great thermometer to check temperatures. Easy to use and also has a good display that works when it is dark.

[AmzBBQ Gloves](https://www.amazon.de/AMZBBQ-Premium-Grillhandschuhe-Ofenhandschuhe-Hitzebest%C3%A4ndig/dp/B07CN7FBBH/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=amzbbq&qid=1598886330&sr=8-5). Great gloves that handle high temperature very well. I have recently switched to "Brovn" gloves that come with the Brovn dutch oven. However the AMZBBQ gloves work excellent as well and are a more low budget option that I have used for years.

I will be slowly adding more tools here.
